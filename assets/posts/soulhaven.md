# Soul Haven by The GoodDemons
<h2> <font color='#FCBEBB'>Animation UI Process</font></h2>

I was tasked with implementing interesting button animations and did some competitive research of other cozy, incremental games.

Then I referenced some tutorials, I created a customized shader and squish-and-squeeze animations. 

These implementations are visible on the home screen - shown below.

While polishing and testing our final builds, we received feedback regarding the accessibility of customizing settings like the background music level, and I implemented this accessibility feature with C# scripting.
