        <section class="about-text">
          <p>
            Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Vedant Singh, a second-year Masterâ€™s student at Carnegie Mellon University, where I juggle Mechanical Engineering, Machine Learning, and the occasional existential crisis about AI taking over the world (donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™m training it to be nice).
            I specialize in using machine learning to solve real-world problemsâ€”like predicting solar power generation, detecting objects in real time, and figuring out how to spend less time debugging code. My work blends engineering principles with advanced algorithms, proving that physics and AI can actually get along.
          </p>

          <p>
            When Iâ€™m not staring at a screen filled with Python scripts, you can find me geeking out over cool tech, playing music to stay sane while crunching math problems, or attempting to convince my neural networks to behave. Spoiler: they donâ€™t always listen.
            My mission? To push the boundaries of AI while keeping my coffee consumption in check. If youâ€™re looking for someone whoâ€™s as passionate about solving complex problems as they are about making them sound fun, youâ€™re in the right place. Letâ€™s build something awesomeâ€”and maybe crack a few jokes along the way! ðŸ˜„

                    Vedant is a keen and enthusiastic person. Being the technical head of the team DJS Antariksh, his knowledge surpassed just mechanical boundaries but extended to the fields of Mechatronics. His contribution to the integration between Mechanical and Electronics was noteworthy. He was a catalyst during the entire phase and was aware of the several dependencies and accordingly designed the mechanical structure of the rover to smoothly integrate the electronic components. In addition to the technical competencies, he exhibits good communication and team-building skills, which he has displayed in his tenure on the team. I wish him good luck and success in all his future ventures.

                The exploration and manipulation of unstructured and dynamic environments have long been a cornerstone of robotics research. Autonomous rovers capable of performing complex tasks are essential in scenarios ranging from space exploration to disaster recovery, where human intervention is limited or impossible. The goal of this project was to develop a rover system capable of completing three primary objectives:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Panel Operation and Feedback Observation:</strong> The rover needed to operate a variety of elements on a control panel, including toggling switches, measuring electrical parameters, setting controls, and interpreting visual feedback indicators.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Probe Placement and Retrieval:</strong> The rover had to identify designated locations from a provided map, retrieve probes from an onboard storage unit, and place them accurately in these locations, demonstrating spatial awareness and dexterous manipulation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Autonomous Navigation:</strong> The rover needed to traverse complex environments semi-autonomously and, eventually, fully autonomously, gathering environmental data along its route to aid decision-making.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These capabilities are critical in situations like extraterrestrial exploration missions or hazardous environments where a high degree of precision, adaptability, and autonomy is required.
              </p>
        
              <h3>Methods</h3>
              <p>
                The development process for the rover encompassed several stages, including mechanical design, electronic integration, algorithm development, and testing.
              </p>
              <h4>Mechanical Design</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Manipulator Arm:</strong> A six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm was designed and mounted on the rover to enable precise control over switches, dials, and probes. The end effector incorporated a gripper with adaptive feedback mechanisms for handling various object sizes and textures.
                </li>
                <li>

                This project was developed as part of the International Planetary Aerial Systems Challenge (IPASC), a prestigious design competition organized by the Mars Society South Asia (MSSA). The challenge required designing an astronaut-assistive Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) tailored for Mars operations. This UAV had to be fully equipped and mission-ready, capable of performing critical tasks in Mars' unique atmospheric conditions. The project was an intensive exercise in multidisciplinary design, requiring careful planning and optimization of subsystems while adhering to the constraints imposed by Mars' thin atmosphere and challenging terrain.
              </p>
        
              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                Mars exploration presents a range of challenges, including its low atmospheric pressure, extreme temperature fluctuations, and rugged terrain. These conditions necessitate innovative solutions to support astronauts during surface missions. The objective of this project was to design a UAV capable of assisting astronauts by:

                This project explores the integration of Deep Learning with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to develop a surrogate modeling framework, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Specifically, the research focuses on Bioprosthetic Heart Valves (BHVs), addressing challenges in their design and analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The work has far-reaching implications for personalized medical applications and efficient engineering solutions.
